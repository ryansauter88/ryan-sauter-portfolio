properties would be able to act on the 'containers' themselves, as well as within each 'container' to actually
wrap and resize the content properly. -->

    <!--  I created the "bar" class as the first container, completely independent
of the rest of the document. This would contain the navigation links for the page and the title.
I applied the "bar" class to both the outside 'container' as well as 
the elements within to repeat some CSS properties to each element. -->

    <!-- This divider was created to be the giant overaching "pool" within which I would be able to properly shift
        the "buckets" (flex-bucket) into a column orientation when on mobile. Those buckets house the groups of contents,
        left 'container' with all the headings (flex) against the right 'container' where most of the content will be
        (flex2), which will also need to reorient to columns. It also helps put some more distance (both in the code and the webpage) from the header. -->

                My name is Ryan, and I am an aspiring Full-Stack Application Developer. From a young age, I took pride in my ability to solve increasingly complicated mathematic and logic problems, and was rewarded with a distinctive honor at my high-school graduation for my proficiency in mathematics. However, my perspective is broad and my skillset is wide. I graduated from Purdue University with a B.S. in Psychology, and minors in Classical Language Studies and Collaborative Leadership. For the past two years, I have worked in an event venue, promoted to a Shift Lead position halfway through my tenure. My range of experience is my greatest strength, as my soft skills have been strengthened and my approach to complex problems has been uniquely cultivated.

            both the containers and elements, so then I targeted specific elements in the CSS for finer tweaks. -->

                can be clicked to access the hyperlink. Because of this, I added another "div" which isn't the most semantic,
                but I could not use the figurecaption element, I'm assuming because it does a particular action within a page.
                Of course, that needs its own box for styling, trying to align two absolutely positioned elements would be impossible. -->
